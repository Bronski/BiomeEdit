Using BiomeEdit you can easily manage the biomes of your map.

You can either set the region around you (with radius X) to a biome or use a brush so you can set circular biomes at the location you're looking at.

Due to the fact that the bukkit API for this is quiet new, this whole mod is in an alpha state and will be enhanced step by step. ;-)
